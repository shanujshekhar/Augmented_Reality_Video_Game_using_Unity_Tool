# Interactive Video Game in Augmented Reality using Unity Tool
- Designed an application in which a user can interactively build an augmented 3D scene on a planar surface in the real world.
- My application has two modes: a build mode and a game mode and application starts with a menu of two buttons displaying the two modes.

## Tools and Hardware Used:
- Language Used: C# (Microsoft Visual Studio, Unity, Blender)
- Unity Version: 2018.4.16f1 Personal
- Vuforia Version: 8.3.8
- Laptop Configurations: Inspiron 5580, Memory: 8 GB
- Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz[Cores 4] [Logical/Core 2] Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Home Single Language
- Graphic Card Configurations: NVIDIA GeForce MX150, Shared Memory - 3999MB
- Mobile Device Used: Google Pixel XL, Android Version 10, 128 GB ROM.


## Build Mode 
   In this mode, the user is able to select and place 3D virtual objects in the real world. Virtual objects like: 
   - Greenhouses: A greenhouse can only be placed on a horizontal planar surface in the real world.
   - Spaceships:  A spaceship should only be placed directly above the selected horizontal surface and should be in constant motion. You may pre-define the motion-path.
   - Planets: A planet can be placed anywhere in the real world except the surface. The planets should be in constant circular motion (to make it simple, you may assume the center of the selected horizontal surface as the center of motion). 

## Placement Options

   - For the greenhouse, a joystick to translate the objects in the x-y direction, on the planar horizontal surface and another joystick to rotate them about the normal direction of the surface.

   - For the spaceship, a joystick to translate it in the x-y plane perpendicular to the horizontal surface normal and a slider to adjust its height from the plane.

   - For the planets, a joystick to translate the objects in the x-y direction, a slider to translate the objects in the z direction, and another joystick to rotate them about their own centers.

## Game Mode
  - The spaceships should be in the air in constant motion, but occasionally dropping cargo boxes to the ground, around the greenhouse. The cargo follows the physics and cast proper shadows.
  - The userâ€™s mission is to drag the boxes from the ground into the greenhouse.
  - The greenhouses and spaceships have light sources that will be turned on during night time and illuminate the surroundings.

- ***Day and Night mode***
The lights placed on the spaceships and the greenhouses must turn on when the night mode is
activated; whereas, during the day time, they should be off.
